	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/rikita.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hello! My name is Rikita Hirpara and I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in computer science.
	My hometown is Carol Stream, IL and I went to Glenbard North high school as a part of the 2013 graduating class. Throughout high school, I volunteered
	at Alexian Brothers Hospital and Windsor Park Manor. I also participated in clubs such as Model United Nations and Indian Student Association and was 
	a vice president for the National Honors Society.</p>

	<p>At UIUC, I want to continue my interest in student run organizations. I started off by getting involved in Women in Computer Science, Association 
	for Computing Machinery, and Society of Women Engineers. I got experience with Visual Basic over the summer and now, I am learning Java in CS125.  I am 
	looking forward to gaining more knowledge in the Computer Science field and learning new programming languages.</p>

	<p>	If you want to know more, take a second to look at my <a href="assets/rhirpa3_hirpara_rikita_Resume.pdf">resume</a>!</p>
