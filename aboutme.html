	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/FirstnameLastname.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hello! My name is Rikita Hirpara and I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in computer science.
	My hometown is Carol Stream, IL and I went to Glenbard North high school as a part of the 2013 graduating class. Throughout high school, I volunteered
	at Alexian Brothers Hospital and Windsor Park Manor. I also participated in clubs such as Model United Nations and Indian Student Association and was 
	a vice president for the National Honors Society.</p>

	<p>At UIUC, I want to continue my interest in student run organizations.</p>

	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">résumé</a>!</p>
