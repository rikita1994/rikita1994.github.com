	I would call this website my first project.  Although, I have written some programs in VB.net and now starting Java.  I was assigned to create this website was 
	an assignment for my ENG 100 class, and I was able to learn HTML/CSS by getting some experience in web development.  I also become familiar with Github and 
	Notepad++.  My added novel feature on this website is a slideshow of pictures on the home page.
